Create a class employee. The members should include employee number(int), name(char*), salary(int), designation(char*). Employee number should be of type constant integer. 
Include static data member to keep track of the number of employee objects. Write down all setter, getter functions along with constructor and destructors.
Make all read only functions as constants. Write down copy constructor to deal with shallow copying. Write down at least two functions to demonstrate cascading calls possible.
Your program should have separate implementation from the interface. Write down main function to demonstrate the functionality of your program.
