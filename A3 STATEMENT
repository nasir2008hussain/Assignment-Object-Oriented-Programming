We have studied inheritance in detail.  Based on inheritance concepts solve the following problem. 
Problem Statement:
Develop a simple payroll application for a company; there are three kinds of employees in the system: salaried employee, hourly employee, and commissioned employee. 
Details of these employees is given below: Salaried Employees: name, date of joining, tax rate, salary, set name, get name, calculate salary, constructor, destructor
and any other required functionality. Hourly Employees: name, date of joining, tax rate, hours, hourly rate, set name, get name, calculate salary, constructor, 
destructor and provide other required functions. Commissioned Employee: name, date of joining, tax rate, sales, commission rate, get name, calculate salary, constructor,
destructor and provide other  required functions You have to perform following tasks 
1.Draw object-oriented model of the system using class hierarchy. 
2.Implement appropriate constructor and destructor. 
3.Write down appropriate setter/getter functions. Incorporate String & date classes in the class hierarchy to deal with name and date of joining of the employee.
4.Implement other member functions described above.
5.The system should take input as an array containing employee objects, calculates salary and generates report. 
6.Demonstrate (5) using main function
