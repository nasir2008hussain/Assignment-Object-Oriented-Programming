STATEMENT Design and implement a C++ class named Array. You are expected to provide the following functionalities: 
A constant data member to hold the size of the array. It should be initialized using an argument when the constructor is called.
If the argument is negative, it should be initialized to 1.
A pointer to integer which should point to a memory portion allocated in constructor (using the size data member) and deallocated in destructor.
Note that the size of allocated memory cannot change once an instance has been initialized (because the size data member is constant). 
A data member named local_average for storing the average of all integers in a particular instance of your Array. 
A static data member named global_count, which represents the number of Array objects initialized in your program. 
A static data member named global_size, which represents the total number of integers your class has allocated to various instances. 
A static data member named global_average for storing the average of all integers of all Array instances initialized. 
Overload stream insertion << and stream extraction operators for class Array Overload + and – operator to add and subtract
corresponding elements of two array object having same size. Overload subscript operator [] for the objects of class Array.
Overload function operator () such that the statement cout<<ArrObject(1,3) can be used to print first three elements of the array object.
Overload ++ and – operator to increment and decrement all array elements by 1 respectively.
Write a driver program to test your class by inputting from user the number of Array instances he wants to create, their sizes and their values in an orderly fashion.
While updating values, local_average and global_average should be printed after every change. Test all the overloaded operators in the driver function.
